# Raw Artifacts Manifest

date: 2026-06-15

purpose: honest inventory of every raw input that fed this consolidation, where it is
preserved, and **what is NOT yet preserved** — so we can review and confirm nothing is lost.

status legend: **preserved-verbatim** · **preserved-condensed** (a readable rendering, not
the exact paste) · **distilled-only** (analyzed into outputs, raw not kept) · **MISSING**.

## Preserved

| Raw artifact | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GroupDynamics.zip (4 produced docs) | `discovery/GroupDynamics.zip` + `seeds/groupdynamics-unpacked/` | preserved-verbatim |
| Sovereign Commons dossier | `discovery/SOVEREIGN-COMMONS-DOSSIER.md` | preserved-verbatim |
| Achilles-heel research prompt | `seeds/generated-prompts/` | preserved-verbatim |
| V1–V9 visibility-test prompt | `seeds/generated-prompts/` | preserved-verbatim |
| PR #3 conversation (desc + 70 reviews + 30 inline) | `Proofs/encrypted-local-first-atproto/PR-CONVERSATION.md` | preserved-verbatim (from gh) |
| PR #4 conversation | `experiments/public-roundtrip/PR-CONVERSATION.md` | preserved-verbatim (from gh) |
| PR #6 conversation | `experiments/appview-validation/PR-CONVERSATION.md` | preserved-verbatim (from gh) |
| PR #8 conversation | `Proofs/lineage-groups/PR-CONVERSATION.md` | preserved-verbatim (from gh) |
| PR #9 conversation | `Proofs/lineage-group-model/PR-CONVERSATION.md` | preserved-verbatim (from gh) |
| PR #3/#4/#6/#8/#9 full code trees | the `Proofs` and `experiments` repos | preserved-verbatim |

## Code — verbatim confirmed

Each proof/experiment tree was `git clone`d from its croftc SecurityPolicy PR branch and
copied unchanged. `diff -rq` against the branches is **empty** (only the added
PR-CONVERSATION/CODING-TRANSCRIPT files and excluded SecurityPolicy plumbing differ). Code
provenance is verbatim.

## Coding transcripts — now preserved verbatim (raw archive) + condensed

The verbatim raw coding transcripts are archived in `seeds/transcripts/raw/`. A readable,
condensed rendering also sits next to each artifact as `CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md`.

| Coding transcript | Verbatim raw | Condensed |
|---|---|---|
| PR #6 appview-validation | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr6-appview-validation.md` | `experiments/appview-validation/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| PR #4 public-roundtrip / capstone / moderation | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr4-public-roundtrip.md` | `experiments/public-roundtrip/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| PR #9 lineage-group-model | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr9-lineage-group-model.md` | `Proofs/lineage-group-model/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| PR #8 lineage-groups Phase 0/1 | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr8-lineage-groups.md` | `Proofs/lineage-groups/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| PR #3 encrypted-local-first | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr3-encrypted-local-first.md` | `Proofs/encrypted-local-first-atproto/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| PR #7 android-p2p-app | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr7-android-p2p.md` | `experiments/android-p2p-app/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| PR #5 encrypted-blob-share | `seeds/transcripts/raw/pr5-encrypted-blob-share.md` | `experiments/encrypted-blob-share/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` |
| Germ/X Chat design dialogue | `seeds/transcripts/raw/germ-xchat-design-dialogue.md` | distilled → thinking/interaction-tiers.md + principles Tier 3 |
| Croft crofting research | `seeds/transcripts/raw/croft-crofting-research.md` | distilled → NAMING.md |

Fidelity note: the raw files reproduce the pastes verbatim, except (a) in-session test
credentials are redacted, and (b) two large embedded briefs already saved verbatim elsewhere
(the lineage thesis → `thinking/thesis-lineage-groups.md`; the experiment-suite spec →
`Proofs/lineage-group-model/CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md`) are referenced rather than triplicated.

## Previously MISSING — now CLOSED

| Raw artifact | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **The original design-dialogue transcript** (Delta Chat/SSB/Signal research + the multi-device → social-layer → scale-axis design conversation, incl. the voice notes, "six tapes," "teenage gossip heaven," fold/unfold, recombine, the two-regime/propagation-geometry material) | **preserved-verbatim** | Re-dropped by the user and filed at `seeds/transcripts/design-dialogue-2026-06-13-to-14.md`. The richest single seed — where the design reasoning happened. Closes the last provenance gap. (Assistant research-phase source citations preserved as they appeared.) |

## Upstream source of record

The five croftc/SecurityPolicy PRs (#3, #4, #6, #8, #9) remain the canonical upstream for
the code and conversations. They are OPEN as of capture; if branches are later merged/deleted,
our imported copies are the preserved record.

## To close the gap

1. Re-drop the original design-dialogue transcript → save verbatim as
   `seeds/transcripts/design-dialogue-2026-06-13-to-14.md`.

2. (Optional) Replace the condensed `CODING-TRANSCRIPT.md` files with the verbatim pastes if
   exact fidelity is wanted for review.
