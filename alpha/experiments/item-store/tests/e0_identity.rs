//! Phase 1 wiring test — ports E0 (identity) from the standalone oracle
//! (`src/exp/e0_identity.ts`): recognition (signature verification) and counting
//! (identifier derivation) rest on the same public key.
//!
//! This is the RED→GREEN gate for Phase 1: it exercises the crate's public API
//! (derive keypair → sign → verify under a pinned key → derive id), not an
//! isolated internal.
