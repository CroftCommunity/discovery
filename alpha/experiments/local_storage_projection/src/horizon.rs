//! EXP-H1 (backlog §2b, RUN-07) — experiment-grade horizon-manifest determinism.
//!
//! This module implements the *minimal* horizon machinery as pure fold-side
//! functions: enough to establish the **manifest-determinism** claim and nothing
//! more. Two members that folded the same governance fact set produce a
//! **byte-identical** horizon manifest regardless of the arrival order of the
//! facts.
//!
//! Scope and non-claims (deliberate):
//!   * There is **no wire format, no persistence, and no networking** here. The
//!     `[gates-release]` horizon-checkpoint manifest encoding (Part 2 §7.6.9) is
//!     untouched and stays `Design`; this earns only the *manifest determinism*
//!     property, not the checkpoint's release-grade byte layout.
//!   * The one byte layout in this file — `frontier_digest` — is an **internal,
//!     experiment-grade** reduction used to name the frontier order-independently.
//!     It is explicitly **NOT** a wire/persistence format and **NOT** the
//!     `[gates-release]` manifest encoding. It exists only so the frontier of the
//!     manifest is a single order-independent value.
//!
//! Why a digest rather than `GroupState::computed_at_gov_head`: that field is the
//! hash of the **last-ingested** governance envelope, which is arrival-order
//! dependent (two members that fold the same set in opposite orders end on
//! different last facts). The order-independent content of the folded state is the
//! membership set, the rules, and the governance sequence — all of which converge
//! by construction (Part 2 §7.3.1/§7.3.2; and for a contradiction, the
//! `resolve_contradiction` replay is order-independent). The frontier digest hashes
//! exactly those, so it converges too.
