//! EXP-H2 (RUN-12 Part 6) — the horizon checkpoint as a foldable **fact**.
//!
//! EXP-H1 (RUN-07, `horizon.rs`) proved the horizon *manifest* computes byte-identically
//! across members and arrival orders; the checkpoint itself was still only a pure
//! function. This lands the **fact form**: a member records a horizon-checkpoint fact
//! carrying its own folded manifest `(frontier digest, manifest)`, and a second member
//! that independently folded the identical set records a co-signing fact naming the same
//! digests. The **corroboration count** for a `(frontier, manifest)` pair is the number
//! of DISTINCT members whose independent fold produced it.
//!
//! §7.3.3 semantics are UNCHANGED (Part 2): a co-signature is corroboration of an
//! *independent identical fold*, **never** a substitute for local validation. A member
//! records only the manifest its OWN fold produced (`CheckpointFact::record` takes a
//! member's own `GroupState`), so a member whose fold does not match contributes nothing
//! to another manifest's corroboration — there is no false corroboration.
//!
//! Scope (deliberate, experiment-grade): fact shapes only, test-only serialization, NO
//! wire pinning. The manifest encoding stays `[gates-release]` (§7.6.9) and the §7.6.9
//! worked example stays `Design`. This module adds **no authority**: a checkpoint fact
//! carries no threshold and gates nothing — an open contradiction remains open truth
//! however many members corroborate its presence (decay is presentation, §7.6.9).
