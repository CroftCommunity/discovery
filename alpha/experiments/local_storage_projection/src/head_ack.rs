//! EXP-C3 (E112) — the HeadAck head-currency primitive.
//!
//! A `HeadAck` is a **§7.3.4 sign-the-state object**: its identity is the *state attested*
//! (`group_id`, `head`, `generation`), so two acks of the same head from different signers are one
//! object with two vouchers — they **union**, they never rival. Freshness for the §7.4 gate is the
//! number of **distinct lineages** (never clients/devices, §5.7) attesting a node's current head.
//!
//! Discipline enforced here:
//!   * **No wall-clock, anywhere.** The horizon is a `generation` (epoch counter). Local elapsed
//!     time, if used at all, is a *private* freshness input — never on the wire (§7.4).
//!   * **A forged ack fails the signature.** Verification is a typestate gate: only a
//!     [`VerifiedHeadAck`] can be recorded, so an unverified/forged ack cannot reach the count.
//!   * **An ack naming an unknown head is a detected GAP, not an authorization input** (§7.4.3):
//!     it means "converge before trusting," and is never counted toward freshness.
//!
//! Fidelity: **Modeled / loopback grade.** Real signature binding (via the `Signer`/`Verifier`
//! traits), a real wire crossing (serialize → re-parse), and distinct-lineage union. The transport
//! is modeled in-process; running the same acks over the FANOUT-M1 `IrohGossipBus` (which carries
//! opaque frames) is a mechanical upgrade, not run in this pass.
