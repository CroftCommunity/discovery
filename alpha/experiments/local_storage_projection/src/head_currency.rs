//! EXP-C2/C3 (E112) — head-currency: the §7.4 freshness precondition, wired to the fold.
//!
//! §7.4 requires that a node originating or co-signing a membership act be **corroborated-fresh**
//! (it can show its head is current) before acting on an irreversible/dependent governance step;
//! otherwise it **fail-closed stalls** while still serving reads on its best-known state. The pure
//! threshold arithmetic lives in [`crate::completeness_ahead`] (`quorum_k`, `admits_irreversible`,
//! `detect_stamp_gap`). This module carries the *state* that makes the precondition real at the
//! fold, and the origination gate a would-be originator MUST consult.
//!
//! Two ingredients, from two directions:
//!   * **Behind-via-traffic (the negative signal, C2).** When the fold holds a fact back with
//!     [`FoldError::MissingAntecedents`], an incoming fact named a head this node has not folded —
//!     so the node knows, *from traffic alone*, that it is behind. This is a detection, not a
//!     corroboration: absence of such traffic proves nothing (the quiet-group case).
//!   * **Corroborated-fresh (the positive signal, C3).** A count of distinct **lineages** (never
//!     clients, §5.7) attesting the node's current head — the freshness the gate needs to *admit*.
//!     Supplied by the HeadAck primitive; seeded as an integer here until C3 wires it.
//!
//! Fidelity: **Modeled / loopback grade.** No wire format and no networking on this path; the
//! freshness count is a plain integer a test seeds, standing in for real attested values.
